                            <p class="paragraph lead">I recently wrote a guide on tools for synchronized cross-device testing; useful when you’re targeting the multi-device web. One of the tools I didn’t come across at the time was <a href="#">Browser-Sync</a>, which has an impressive feature-set and works across all platforms. We’ll talk about it today.</p>

                            <h2>Browser-Sync</h2>
                            <p class="paragraph">Synchronized testing automatically performs the same interaction (clicks, scrolls, etc.) across a number of browsers and devices at the same time. It’s immensely powerful for catching visual regressions and bugs during RWD and multi-device development.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">Browser-Sync is a free, MIT licensed open-source tool by Shane Osbourne which supports synchronizing:</p>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li>Scrolls – keeping page scrolls in sync across devices</li>
                                <li>Clicks & Navigation – clicks persist across all browsers so navigation is kept in sync too</li>
                                <li>Form data – any data entered into a form on one device gets copied to the others</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="paragraph">As well as:</p>
                            <ul class="square">
                                <li>CSS injection – Like Emmet LiveStyle, CSS files are watched for edits, getting injected across all pages without the need for a full browser reload. Really useful for iterating on styles for views and templates.</li>
                                <li>Live Reload – watch local source files and automatically refresh browsers on all devices when a change is made</li>
                                <li>a Static file server – for serving HTML/CSS/JS etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p class="paragraph">You can install Browser-Sync with npm by running: npm install -g browser-sync.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">For a free offering, this is simply amazing, works great on Mac/Windows/Linux and captures the complete feature-set I was originally after for synchronizing interactions and workflow across my devices.</p>
                            <p class="paragraph">In addition to being well documented, Browser-Sync also comes with an optional Grunt task by the same author and works well with a plethora of different setups.</p>
